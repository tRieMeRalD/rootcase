            Coral sand is a naturally occurring type of sand that originates from the great 
            coral reefs of the world. It’s iconic smooth texture and rich colour are common 
            sights at tropical beaches across the globe. Grains of coral sand are produced naturally 
            when small pieces of coral are broken off by marine creatures big and small, and carried by the 
            currents around the planet. However, this incredible natural phenomenon is at risk at being lost 
            forever. Due to increased plastic pollution in the oceans, coral reefs have started to die off around the 
            world. Because of warmer water temperatures, some coral reefs have also begun to bleach, turning pale and 
            losing their rich colours. If this continues, it’s very possible that a future without the simple beauty of 
            coral sand will become a reality.
